Navigate to BigQuery web UI on Google Cloud Console, copy and paste the following query, and then hit the “Run” button.


SELECT
  *
FROM
  [fh-bigquery:reddit_comments.all]
WHERE
  subreddit = 'trumpservative'
  
  
For example, here, we want to get all the comments for 'trumpservative' subreddit. 

You can then save the results, you have two options as CSV file (if it is less than 10 gb), or as a BigQuery Table.
